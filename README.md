### DuoDoodle

With this app, you are able to make your own canvas to doodle on. If you share your canvas name, your friend can join in. Though, chances are your friend will screw up your drawing, so be careful of who you invite...

Made with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [express](http://expressjs.com/), [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)<br>
Project: [duodoodle.wilbo.io](http://duodoodle.wilbo.io). <br>
